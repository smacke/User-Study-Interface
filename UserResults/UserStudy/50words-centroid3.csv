Smoothness of the graph; increasing or decreasing overall trend,Large double hump; smaller hump; and large spike; going from left to right.,Smoother version of what's in Bucket 4 - missing the double hump and smaller hump is more of a part of the large spike on the right. I should have put the third graph in Bucket 4 instead.,Same as Bucket 4; but with additional spikes in between or more variation in the relative heights of the double humps.,Pattern of small and large humps has a substantially different ordering than the reference chart and graphs exhibit a general downward or upward trend overall.
