General graph trends up or down.,Flatness; then small trough; then large spike; from left to right,Most features from Bucket 4 in the correct order; but an additional trough and/or trough in the wrong place relative to reference chart,Follows general trend of reference chart; but has some extra spikes or troughs,Graph's overall shape or trend is very different from reference chart - sum of squared differences would be very large.
