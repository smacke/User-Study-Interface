18,Chicago Time: 2016-12-07 12:32:36pm,,,TS82,TS7;TS149;TS153;TS162;TS147;TS180;TS110;TS210;TS184;TS59;TS196,2,4,I looked for the shape and pattern of the chart,none looked similar,none look kinda similar,this chart looked the most similar because it followed along the same pattern,these all looked different
19,Chicago Time: 2016-12-08 02:03:50pm,,,TS7;TS162;TS147;TS153;TS149,TS59;TS110;TS196;TS180;TS82;TS184;TS210,2,4,see for similar trend and values,empty,empty,a constant value of y (~0) from x=0 to 800 is seen; except the sudden increase in y after x=800 (so part of the data are missing),not similar in shape atleast
20,Chicago Time: 2016-12-09 12:49:53pm,,TS82,TS184;TS59,TS7;TS110;TS196;TS162;TS147;TS180;TS153;TS149;TS210,2,3,looking for graph that starts low then jumps very high at very end and then quickly goes back to original position,None,Starts high; but quickly goes low and stays that way until jump to high at the end,starts low; but then varies; then finally goes high and goes a little lower,very little similarity to each other; kind of all over the place
