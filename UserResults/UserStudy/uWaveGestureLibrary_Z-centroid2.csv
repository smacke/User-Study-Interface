I considered the smoothness of the curve and the similarity of x value in regards  to the shape.,These graphs are both relatively smooth and decrease first than increase.,These graphs are not as smooth. They decrease then increase first though but the x values at the min/max are very different.,Graph generally either only increases or decreases around x=200,Shape is completely different.
